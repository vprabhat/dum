    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/vprabhat/dum.git
    ```

    Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, PyPy are tested with tox.

    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_unused_media',
        ...
    )
    ```

# Usage

To cleanup all unused media files, run management command:
```
./manage.py cleanup_unused_media
```
By default command is running in interactive mode. List of files which are going to be removed will be displayed for confirmation. User have to confirm the action.

### Options

#### `--noinput`, `--no-input`

```
./manage.py cleanup_unused_media --noinput
```

#### `-e`, `--exclude`

To avoid operating on particular files you can use exclude option. 
- *`*` as any symbol is supported.*

```
./manage.py cleanup_unused_media -e *.gitignore -e *.png
```

Also you can exclude entire folder or some files in that folder (path should be relative to `settings.MEDIA_ROOT`):
```
./manage.py cleanup_unused_media -e path/to/dir/* -e path/to/dir/my*.doc
```

#### `--remove-empty-dirs`

Buy default script keep empty dirs in media folder. But with this option empty directories will be removed after cleaning process automatically.
